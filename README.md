# Coin Collector

Coin Collector is a third person game to demonstate my learning as well as the skills I gained during the module within Unreal Engine 4 and C++.

This project was completed in the second semester of my 'Game Engine Programming' module in the second year of my 'Computer Games Development' degree at Staffordshire University.

## Goals & Requirements
The goal for this assignment was to demonstrate game development techniques including; input, menus, UI, collisions, particles, lighting, etc and their applications using C++ and the Unreal Engine 4 game engine as taught in the module.


## Project Thinking
I decided to create a third person game as I wanted to create a different type of game to my first semester unity project. So I decided to create a project where the player must collect all the coins while being chased by the AI agent.

I found this to be a good way to use this project to explore UE4 and understand and learn about the engine and how to implement the game development technqiues that were taught during the module.


## Key Learnings
As this project was my first ever experience using UE4 it was a challenging but enjoyable experience allowing me to develop my learning during the module and demonstrate my new found knowledge of Unreal and C++ as well as allow me to experiment with the techniques that I learnt during the module.
