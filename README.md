# Coin Collector

Coin Collector is a third person game which was my first experience using Unreal Engine 4, demonstating my learning as well as the skills I gained during the module within UE4 and C++.

This project was completed in the second semester of my 'Game Engine Programming' module in the second year of my 'Computer Games Development' degree at Staffordshire University.

- Win / Loss Conditions
- Particle Effects


## Goals & Requirements
The goal for this assignment was to demonstrate game development techniques including; input, menus, UI, collisions, particles, lighting, etc and their applications using C++ and the Unreal Engine 4 game engine as taught in the module.


## Project Thinking
I decided to create a third person game as I wanted to create a different type of game to my first semester unity project. I then decided to create a project where the player must collect all the coins while being chased by an AI agent.

I found this idea to be a simple but effective project to be able to explore UE4 and understand and learn about the engine and how to implement the game development technqiues that were taught during the module.


## Key Learnings
This project was my introduction into using Unreal Engine 4
- Learnt basic game development techniques
- How to implement game dev techniques in UE4 
- Further developed my C++ skills and how to apply them in UE4
- Learnt visual scripting using Blueprints
- How to use C++ & Blueprints effectivly together within UE

Overall, as this project was my first ever experience using UE4 it was challenging but enjoyable and allowed me to develop my learning during the module and demonstrate my new found knowledge of Unreal and C++ as well as allow me to experiment with the techniques that I learnt during the module.
